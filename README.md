I hope this helps. Please follow my profile to see my work. Hopefully it will help.
For a beginner it took me 30 hours.
I built it in vscode together with fcc environment. There were 69 steps.
I also tried to make notes for each step with somewhat in simpler words to make it easier for a beginner to understand.
I also made a list of each element, attribute and value used with explanations about them.
One can just read the whole catphotoapp information altogether.
in a few pages rather than having to go through the whole exercise.
It will be awesome if you split your screen with code on one, and another for notes.
It will be help to see it like a picture.
I would like to thank freecodecamp for providing the education for free.
